### A little about me :
---
Hello! My name is Jack Goldsworth and I am a Software Engineering student.
I am a big fan of free t-shirts and programming, so when they come together I get excited.
I have been programming for four years, mainly in Java and recently Python. My areas of interest
are in Artificial Intelligence and more of the back end stuff, although sometimes UI is fun.
